        <h2>About Ladakh</h2>
        <p>
            Prayagraj is one of the oldest cities in India. It is crowned in ancient scriptures 
            as ‘Prayag’ or ‘Teertharaj’ and is considered the holiest of pilgrimage centres of India. 
            It is situated at the confluence of three rivers- Ganga, Yamuna and the invisible Saraswati. 
            The meeting point is known as Triveni and is very sacred to Hindus. The Kumbh held in every six years and Mahakumbh in every 12 years at Prayagraj
             (Sangam) are the largest gatherings of pilgrims on this earth.
            Historically, the city has been a witness to many important events in India’s freedom 
            struggle such as emergence of the first Indian National Congress in 1885, the beginning of Mahatma Gandhi’s non-violence movement in 1920.
            Geographically, Prayagraj is located at 25.45°N 81.84°E in the southern part of the Uttar Pradesh. To its south and southeast is the
